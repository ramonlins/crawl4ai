## What are credits?
Credits are a unit of account that we use to bill usage for RPCs, API requests, and data streaming products like LaserStream and Enhanced WebSockets. Every plan has a base number of credits, and every API call has an assigned credit cost. Below, we outline the credits per plan, credit costs by API, and credits for streaming data.
## Monthly Allocation
Credits reset monthly
## Credit Priority
Credits are consumed in this order: monthly, prepaid, autoscaling
## Flexible Billing
Pay for additional credits when needed
## Base Credits by Plan
Here is a breakdown of the total number of credits that are included by default in each plan. If you need more credits, upgrade your plan, enable [autoscaling](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/autoscaling), purchase prepaid credits, or contact sales to discuss enterprise options. For more information, read our [plans and pricing guide](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/plans)

| **Pricing**  | $0/month  |  ~~$49~~ $24.50/month  | $499/month  | $999/month  |  
| **Monthly Credits**  | 1M  | 10M  | 100M  | 200M  |

## Historical Data Credits
[Historical data queries](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/guides/overview#historical-data-archival), sometimes called archival calls, cost **1 credit** each. One exception is [`getTransactionsForAddress`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/rpc/gettransactionsforaddress) which costs **50 credits**.  
| Method  | Credits  | Description  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| `getBlock`  | 1  | Retrieve block data and transactions for a specified slot  |  
| `getBlocks`  | 1  | Get list of blocks between two slots  |  
| `getBlocksWithLimit`  | 1  | Get blocks starting at a given slot with limit  |  
| `getSignaturesForAddress`  | 1  | Get transaction signatures for an address  |

**Plan Requirement** : `getTransactionsForAddress` is only available on Developer plans and above. Free plan users will receive an error when attempting to use this endpoint.
## Data Streaming Credits
Unlike regular credits that assign credits per call, data streaming products like Enhanced WebSockets and LaserStream assign credits per amount of data consumed.  
| Service  | Credits  | Notes  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Standard WebSockets**  | 2  | Per 0.1 MB of streamed data (uncompressed). All plans.  |  
| **LaserStream gRPC**  | 2  | Per 0.1 MB of streamed data (uncompressed)  |  
| **Enhanced WebSockets**  | 2  | Per 0.1 MB of streamed data (uncompressed). Developer, Business, and Professional plans.  |  
| **Data Add-on (Pro Plan only)**  | 2  | Per 0.1 MB after included allowance (5-100TB). Applies to LaserStream and Enhanced WebSockets usage.  |  
### Standard WebSockets
All WebSocket streaming at Helius is now [powered by LaserStream infrastructure](https://www.helius.dev/blog/laserstream-websockets). Standard WSS traffic is metered at **2 credits per 0.1 MB** across all plans.
**WSS Metering Grace Period** : WSS metering activates for all projects on **May 1, 2026**. A 30-day grace period is in effect from the announcement date (March 31, 2026). Previously unmetered WSS traffic will be billed at the unified rate of 2 credits per 0.1 MB after the grace period ends.
### Enhanced WebSockets
[Enhanced WebSockets](https://www.helius.dev/docs/enhanced-websockets) are available on Developer, Business, and Professional plans. All Enhanced WSS usage is metered at **2 credits per 0.1 MB**.
### LaserStream
[LaserStream](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream) Mainnet is available on Business and Professional plans. LaserStream Devnet is available on Developer, Business, and Professional plans. All users pay **2 credits per 0.1 MB** usage.
### Data Add-ons
If you’re on a Professional plan, you may purchase [Data Add-ons](https://www.helius.dev/docs/billing/plans#data-add-ons) between 5TB-100TB per month to be used for both Enhanced WebSockets and LaserStream. Overages will be billed at 2 credits per 0.1 MB.
### Data Size
Billing for data streaming products is based on uncompressed message size. Typical sizes include:
  * Block (~4MB)
  * Account (~0.0004MB)
  * Transaction (~0.0006MB)


**These are rough estimates only.** Actual data usage depends on your specific use case, including account size, transaction type, which programs you’re listening to, and transaction metadata size. You should estimate usage based on your own traffic. Treat the values above as directional estimates, not guarantees.
## Transaction Submission Credits
Helius offers two primary transaction submission methods: [Sender](https://www.helius.dev/docs/sending-transactions/sender), our specialized transaction landing service for traders and low-latency applications; and [Staked Connections](https://www.helius.dev/docs/sending-transactions/overview) (default) for fast, reliable landing rates.  
| Method  | Credits  | Description  |  
| --- | --- | --- |  
| **Sender**  | 0  | Ultra-low latency submission  |  
| **Staked Connections**  | 1  | Highest reliability (default)  |
