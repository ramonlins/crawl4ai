## How to Order Dedicated Nodes
Dedicated Nodes can be ordered directly from the [developer portal](https://dashboard.helius.dev/dedicated-nodes) on the Dedicated Nodes tab.

### Node Type
The type of node you choose depends on your requirements. Since we don’t impose any rate limits, your node’s performance will rely entirely on its specifications. **For gRPC streaming applications** (primary use case), any node type will perform well.
**Important** : While [`getProgramAccounts`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts) is supported, dedicated nodes are not optimized for these calls. Heavy usage can impact node performance or even cause node failure. Use your shared plan for `getProgramAccounts` queries as it has a custom indexer that makes these calls much faster and more reliable.
Choose your dedicated node's type and location
### Node Location
We offer nodes across multiple regions: in North America (Pittsburgh, Newark, Salt Lake City, Los Angeles, Vancouver); in Europe (Dublin, London, Amsterdam, Frankfurt); and in Asia (Tokyo, Singapore) to ensure the best geographic coverage with the global Solana infrastructure. For optimal latency, choose a node closest to your server. Your node will be deployed within three hours of payment.
### Node Client
You can customize your node by selecting the client type — either Agave or Jito Labs (fork of Agave with an additional method `simulateBundle`)
Select your dedicated node's client type
Dedicated nodes **cannot** send Jito Bundles on their own. To send Jito Bundles, you must use the Jito API, which handles packaging and sending the bundles through Jito’s system.
### Geyser Plugin (Recommended)
**We strongly recommend adding the[Yellowstone](https://github.com/helius-labs/yellowstone-grpc) Geyser Plugin**, which is the primary use case for dedicated nodes. It provides high-performance [gRPC streaming](https://www.helius.dev/docs/grpc) of slots, blocks, transactions, and account updates.
Select the Yellowstone gRPC Geyser Plugin (Recommended)
**Best Practice** : Dedicated nodes are optimized for gRPC streaming. Use your shared plan for transaction submission, archival queries, and complex RPC operations.
### Payment Options
You can pay via fiat or crypto (USDC). Once your payment goes through, your node will be deployed within 3 hours. For billing, fiat payments will receive a discount on the next month’s bill for the number of days it took to provision the node. For crypto payments, the billing cycle starts once the node is delivered.
### Demo
## Getting Started
Once you have your Dedicated Node set up and ready (status: **Succeeded**), you can start working with it.

### gRPC Streaming (Primary Use Case)
**Dedicated nodes are optimized for gRPC streaming via the Yellowstone Geyser Plugin.** This is the primary and recommended way to use your dedicated node.
**Consider LaserStream for gRPC Streaming** : LaserStream offers superior performance, reliability, and advanced features like 24-hour historical replay for gRPC streaming. It’s recommended for 99% of streaming use cases. [Compare LaserStream vs Dedicated Nodes](https://www.helius.dev/docs/laserstream/laserstream-vs-dedicated-nodes) to evaluate the best solution for your needs, and submit this application to [apply for a 2-day LaserStream trial](https://www.helius.dev/laserstream-contact).
### Basic RPC and Websocket (Limited Functionality)
Each dedicated node also provides basic RPC functionality, but with limitations. **For production applications, combine dedicated nodes with a shared plan.** Here we are using Solana web3.js to call [`getSlot`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getslot) using our dedicated node:

```
// Using @solana/web3.js
const { Connection } = require('@solana/web3.js');

const connection = new Connection('https://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated.helius-rpc.com?api-key=465964ff-f718-47d2-a51c-66ddcce332d7');

// Get the current slot
const getSlot = async () => {
    const slot = await connection.getSlot();
    console.log('Current slot:', slot);


getSlot();

```

This is how you would set up a native websocket connection to stream new slots:

```
const Websocket = require('ws');
const ws = new Websocket('wss://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated.helius-rpc.com?api-key=465964ff-f718-47d2-a51c-66ddcce332d7	');

ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        jsonrpc: '2.0',
        id: 1,
        method: 'slotSubscribe'
    }));


ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    console.log(JSON.parse(event.data));


```

**Remember** : The above RPC examples are for basic functionality only. Dedicated nodes limitations:
  * [`sendTransaction`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/sendtransaction) supported but not optimized - most transactions will not land (use your shared plan for reliable transaction submission)
  * No archival data queries (use your shared plan)
  * [`getProgramAccounts`](https://www.helius.dev/docs/api-reference/rpc/http/getprogramaccounts) supported but not optimized - heavy usage can impact performance or cause node failure (use your shared plan for reliability)

**Primary use case** : Use the gRPC streaming setup below for optimal performance.
### Set up your Geyser Plugin
To begin using the Geyser plugin you need to clone the Yellowstone repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/helius-labs/yellowstone-grpc.git

```

#### Using the CLI

```
cd yellowstone-grpc/examples/rust/
cargo run --bin client -- -e "https://liveried-grazings-gxzjabdgqa-dedicated-lb.helius-rpc.com:2053" --x-token 42f03938-1daa-4162-a457-bb551ecaf590 subscribe --slots

```

Once complete, you should see the terminal output new slots. Don’t forget to replace the URL and Token with your own.

### TypeScript Example
This example streams all Raydium transactions live in JSON format:

```
import Client, { CommitmentLevel, SubscribeRequest } from "@triton-one/yellowstone-grpc";
import * as bs58 from 'bs58';

const processBuffers = (obj: any): any =>
  !obj ? obj :
  Buffer.isBuffer(obj) || obj instanceof Uint8Array ? bs58.encode(obj) :
  Array.isArray(obj) ? obj.map(processBuffers) :
  typeof obj === 'object' ? Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(obj).map(([k, v]) => [k, processBuffers(v)])) :
  obj;

const main = async () => {
  const client = new Client("grpc_url", 
    "x_token", 
"grpc.max_receive_message_length": 64 * 1024 * 1024 });

  const stream = await client.subscribe();
  const write = (req: SubscribeRequest) => new Promisevoid>((resolve, reject) =>
    stream.write(req, (err) => err ? reject(err) : resolve()));

  stream.on("data", (data) => {
    try { console.log(JSON.stringify(processBuffers(data), null, 2)); }
    catch (e) { console.error('Error:', e); }
  });

  await write({
    slots: {},
    accounts: {},
    accountsDataSlice: [],
    transactions: {
      allRaydiumTxs: {
        accountInclude: ["675kPX9MHTjS2zt1qfr1NYHuzeLXfQM9H24wFSUt1Mp8"],
        accountExclude: [],
        accountRequired: [],


    blocks: {},
    blocksMeta: {},
    entry: {},
    commitment: CommitmentLevel.PROCESSED,
  });

  setInterval(() => write({
    ping: { id: 1 },
    accounts: {},
    accountsDataSlice: [],
    transactions: {},
    blocks: {},
    blocksMeta: {},
    entry: {},
    slots: {},
  }).catch(console.error), 30000);

  await new Promisevoid>((resolve, reject) => {
    stream.on("error", (e) => { console.error("Stream error:", e); reject(e); stream.end(); });
    stream.on("end", resolve);
    stream.on("close", resolve);
  });


main().catch(console.error);

```
